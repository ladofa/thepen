# ThePen
ThePen is a software for drawing on screen in Windows. It started just for my online lectures. I don't have any specific plan to push this work. But I really hope it used widely and be helpful for you.

 * Easy Switch : Just by lifting the stylus pen, it switches to drawing mode. And just move your mouse to escape drawing mode.
   - It doesn't work on some applications(Chrome, Edge, VSCode, etc.). In this case, move your pen to edges of the monitor to switch mode.
